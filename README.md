# IGVBrowse
A shiny app for browsing data with Rend-Seq

## Status: Proof-of-concept (as of 1 February 2023)

Right now, this is just a single-file Shiny App to create a browser for Rend-Seq data using IGVjs. 

Eventually, we might want to incorporate this into Mirae's rendseq website, and build-out functionality.
